# Rock Paper Scissors Game
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game played to settle disputes between two people. 

The game is played with three possible hand signals that represent a rock, paper, and scissors. The rock is a closed fist, paper is a flat hand with fingers and thumb extended and the palm facing downward, and scissors is a fist with the index and middle fingers fully extended toward the opposing player.

Rock wins against scissors, paper wins against rock, and scissors wins against paper. If both players throw the same hand signal, it is considered a tie, and play resumes until there is a clear winner.
